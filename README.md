### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm official_troller.

I mostly work with:
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

Past projects:
* [automodbot](https://github.com/officialtroller/automodbot) A simple auto mod Discord Bot that you can setup through simple commands.
* [youtube-music-application](https://github.com/officialtroller/youtube-music-application)  A small Electron Application featuring [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) as App with Discord Activity.

  You can find other small projects on my [Discord Server](discord.gg/JFCXza3tnd) too.
